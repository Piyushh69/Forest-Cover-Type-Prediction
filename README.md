## Description
This project aims to predict forest cover types using machine learning classifiers based on cartographic variables. I have explored and compared multiple algorithms to identify the most accurate and efficient model for this task.

## Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Piyushh69/Forest-Cover-Type-Prediction.git

## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook Forest_Cover_Type_Prediction.ipynb to explore the project.
Follow the step-by-step code and explanations for predictions and classifier comparison.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is the "Forest CoverType" dataset, obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains cartographic variables, wilderness area designations, soil type designations, and forest cover type labels.

## Results
The accuracy achieved by the selected classifier (KNN) is 96.52%. The analysis also revealed significant patterns and trends in the dataset, enabling us to make accurate predictions of forest cover types based on the given variables.

## Future Work
In future work, we plan to explore advanced feature engineering techniques, try ensemble methods, and fine-tune hyperparameters to improve the model's performance further. Additionally, incorporating remotely sensed data and additional environmental features may enhance prediction accuracy.
